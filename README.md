Battlefield Bad Company 2 HitFixer
==================================

A simple program which tries to improve ("fix") the hit detection for Battlefield Bad Company 2.

How It All Started
==================

The idea started in 2010, few months after Bad Company 2 ("BC2") was released. The EA DICE's game had various big issues with the hit detection (and it still has). Many people on various sites and forums tried to offer some "fixes" to improve it, most of them didn't work while few of them seemed to work.

So here's where the developing process of the program started, the purpose was to use the "fixes" in a easy way so everyone could do it without any major hassle.

Does It Work?
=============

The most common question I get since I've published this program is: "does it work?". There's no definitive answer, some says it works, others say it doesn't work and it's just placebo. You can find some video proofs which show it working (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erZPhcwkSw0), but there isn't any proof in the game's files that indicates if the "fix" is even recognized.

At the end the only way to know if it does work or not is to try it out yourself, at worst nothing changes.

BC2 HitFixer 1, 2 and 3
=======================

There are three different versions which show the progress I've made during the developing stages. Naturally the third version it's the latest updated version and if you aren't interested in the source codes then the "Bad Company 2 HitFixer 3" is the best one.

All of them were written in Visual Basic .NET while using Visual Studio 2010. First time I used VB.NET and published the programs.
